# CloudBees Unify SDLC Metrics - GitHub Actions Demo

This repository demonstrates CloudBees Unify's metrics and analytics capabilities when integrated with GitHub Actions workflows. It showcases how to collect and visualize DORA metrics, deployment analytics, and software delivery insights across your CI/CD pipeline.

## Overview

This demo application validates the CloudBees Unify metrics functionality, specifically focusing on:

- **DORA Metrics Dashboard**: Deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, and MTTR
- **Deployment Analytics**: Component summary, deployment overview, and activity tracking
- **Artifact Traceability**: Version history with deployment details across environments
- **Environment Inventory**: Track artifact versions promoted across dev, staging, and production
- **Test Results Publishing**: Unit test results and coverage metrics
- **Security Scanning**: CodeQL integration for security insights
- **Build Evidence**: Comprehensive build and deployment evidence tracking

## Architecture

### Application
- **Language**: Node.js 18
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Testing**: Jest with coverage reporting
- **Linting**: ESLint
- **Security**: GitHub CodeQL scanning

### CI/CD Pipeline
The workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) includes:

1. **Test Job**: Runs unit tests and publishes results to CloudBees Unify
2. **Lint Job**: Code quality checks with ESLint
3. **CodeQL Scan**: GitHub-native security scanning (no self-hosted runner required)
4. **Build Job**: Creates artifacts and registers them in CloudBees Unify
5. **Deploy Jobs**: Deploys to dev/staging/production with artifact registration for DORA metrics

### Environments
- **Development**: Auto-deploys from `develop` branch
- **Staging**: Auto-deploys from `main` branch (with smoke tests)
- **Production**: Manual approval required, deploys from `main` after staging

## Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure you have:

1. **CloudBees Unify Account**: Access to a CloudBees Unify instance
2. **GitHub Repository**: This repository pushed to GitHub
3. **Jira Board** (Optional): For linking work items to deployments
4. **GitHub Actions**: Enabled on your repository

## Setup Instructions

### 1. CloudBees Unify Configuration

#### Create Environments in Unify
Before running workflows, create the following environments in CloudBees Unify:

```yaml
- development (non-production)
- staging (non-production)
- production (production)
```

You can use the `cloudbees-environments.yml` file as a reference for environment configuration.

#### Get API Credentials
1. Log into your CloudBees Unify instance
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Tokens**
3. Create a new token with permissions:
   - `artifact:write`
   - `deployment:write`
   - `test-results:write`
   - `evidence:write`

### 2. GitHub Repository Configuration

#### Configure Secrets
Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
- Go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**
- Add the following repository secrets:

```
# Required CloudBees Unify secrets
# Note: The CloudBees GHA actions handle authentication via OIDC
# No explicit token configuration needed if OIDC is configured
```

#### Configure GitHub Environments
1. Go to **Settings** > **Environments**
2. Create three environments:
   - `development`: No protection rules
   - `staging`: No protection rules (or add required reviewers if desired)
   - `production`: Add required reviewers and enable "Wait timer" if desired

### 3. CloudBees OIDC Setup

The CloudBees GitHub Actions use OIDC authentication. Configure the trust relationship:

1. In CloudBees Unify, go to **Settings** > **Identity Providers**
2. Add GitHub as an OIDC provider
3. Configure the trust policy for your repository:
   ```
   repo:your-org/sdlc-metrics-gha:*
   ```

### 4. Initial Workflow Run

1. Push this code to your GitHub repository
2. Create a `develop` branch: `git checkout -b develop && git push -u origin develop`
3. Make a commit to `develop` to trigger the workflow
4. The workflow will:
   - Run tests and publish results
   - Perform CodeQL scan
   - Build and register the artifact
   - Deploy to development environment

## Validating Metrics in CloudBees Unify

### 1. Test Results
Navigate to **Analytics** > **Test Results** in CloudBees Unify:
- View test execution trends
- See test coverage metrics
- Identify flaky tests
- Track test duration over time

### 2. Build Artifacts
Go to **Components** > **Your Component**:
- See all registered artifact versions
- View build evidence for each version
- Check artifact labels and metadata
- Trace artifacts to source commits

### 3. Deployment Tracking
View **Environment Inventory**:
- See which versions are deployed to each environment
- Track deployment history
- View artifact progression through environments

### 4. DORA Metrics Dashboard
Navigate to **Analytics** > **DORA Metrics**:

**Deployment Frequency**
- Track how often deployments occur to each environment
- View trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Compare frequency across different components

**Lead Time for Changes**
- Measure time from commit to production deployment
- Identify bottlenecks in your delivery pipeline
- Track improvement over time

**Change Failure Rate**
- See percentage of deployments that cause failures
- Monitor quality trends
- Compare rates across environments

**Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**
- Track how quickly issues are resolved
- View recovery time trends
- Set targets and monitor progress

### 5. Deployment Analytics
Access additional deployment insights:
- **Component Summary**: Overview of deployment activity
- **Software Delivery Activity**: Team velocity and throughput
- **Code Progression**: Successful deployments tracking
- **Average Deployment Time**: Performance metrics

## Testing the Workflow

### Trigger a Development Deployment
```bash
git checkout develop
echo "// test change" >> src/index.js
git add .
git commit -m "Test deployment to dev"
git push
```

### Trigger a Production Deployment
```bash
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push
# Approve the production deployment in GitHub Actions
```

### Simulate a Failed Deployment
To test change failure rate metrics, you can intentionally fail a deployment:

1. Modify the workflow to add a failure step
2. Push the change
3. The failure will be tracked in CloudBees Unify
4. Fix the issue and redeploy
5. MTTR will be calculated based on the recovery time

## Key CloudBees Actions Used

### `cloudbees-io-gha/publish-test-results@v2`
Publishes test results to CloudBees Unify for test analytics.

```yaml
- uses: cloudbees-io-gha/publish-test-results@v2
  with:
    test-type: junit
    results-path: junit.xml
```

### `cloudbees-io-gha/register-build-artifact@v3`
Registers build artifacts for traceability.

```yaml
- uses: cloudbees-io-gha/register-build-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: ${{ github.repository }}
    url: https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
    version: ${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}
    type: npm-package
```

### `cloudbees-io-gha/register-deployed-artifact@v1`
**NEW** (Phase 1): Registers deployments for DORA metrics tracking.

```yaml
- uses: cloudbees-io-gha/register-deployed-artifact@v1
  with:
    artifact-id: ${{ needs.build.outputs.artifact_id }}
    environment: production
    version: ${{ needs.build.outputs.version }}
```

**Note**: This action is part of the Phase 1 epic implementation. If the action name differs or is not yet available, see `NOTES.md` for alternatives including API-based registration.

### `cloudbees-io-gha/label-artifact-version@v1`
Adds labels to artifacts for filtering and organization.

```yaml
- uses: cloudbees-io-gha/label-artifact-version@v1
  with:
    artifact-id: ${{ steps.register-artifact.outputs.cbp_artifact_id }}
    labels: "main,nodejs,express,automated"
```

### `cloudbees-io-gha/publish-evidence-item@v2`
Publishes build and deployment evidence.

```yaml
- uses: cloudbees-io-gha/publish-evidence-item@v2
  with:
    content: |-
      # Build Evidence Report
      ...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow fails with authentication error
- Verify OIDC trust relationship is configured in CloudBees Unify
- Check that the repository is allowed in the trust policy
- Ensure `id-token: write` permission is set in the workflow

### Test results not appearing in Unify
- Verify the test results file exists: `junit.xml`
- Check that `publish-test-results` action ran successfully
- Confirm component is configured in CloudBees Unify

### Artifacts not registered
- Check build job completed successfully
- Verify artifact ID is being captured in outputs
- Ensure `register-build-artifact` action has correct permissions

### Deployments not tracked for DORA metrics
- Confirm environments exist in CloudBees Unify
- Verify `register-deployed-artifact` action is running
- Check that artifact-id is being passed correctly from build job

### CodeQL scan taking too long
- This is normal for first run (builds cache)
- Subsequent runs will be faster
- Can run in parallel with other jobs

## Customization

### Add More Environments
1. Add environment definition in `cloudbees-environments.yml`
2. Create environment in CloudBees Unify
3. Add new deploy job in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
4. Configure environment in GitHub repository settings

### Integrate with Jira
Add Jira issue keys to commits to link deployments to work items:

```bash
git commit -m "PROJ-123: Add new feature"
```

CloudBees Unify will automatically associate deployments with Jira issues.

### Use Different CI Providers
The same CloudBees actions are available for:
- Jenkins/CBCI (pipeline steps)
- Other CI systems (API-based integration)
