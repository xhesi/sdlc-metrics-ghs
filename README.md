# CloudBees Unify SDLC Metrics - GitHub Actions Demo

This repository demonstrates CloudBees Unify's metrics and analytics capabilities when integrated with GitHub Actions workflows. It showcases how to collect and visualize DORA metrics, deployment analytics, and software delivery insights across your CI/CD pipeline.
 
## Overview
 
This demo application validates the CloudBees Unify metrics functionality, specifically focusing on:

- **DORA Metrics Dashboard**: Deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, and MTTR
- **Deployment Analytics**: Component summary, deployment overview, and activity tracking
- **Artifact Traceability**: Version history with deployment details across environments
- **Environment Inventory**: Track artifact versions promoted across dev, staging, and production
- **Test Results Publishing**: Unit test results and coverage metrics
- **Security Scanning**: CodeQL for code vulnerabilities + Gitleaks for secret detection
- **Secret Management**: Automated test secrets workflow for validation

## Architecture

### Application
- **Language**: Node.js 18
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Testing**: Jest with coverage reporting
- **Linting**: ESLint
- **Security**: GitHub CodeQL scanning + Gitleaks secret detection

### CI/CD Pipeline
The workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) includes:

1. **Test Job**: Runs unit tests and publishes results to CloudBees Unify
2. **Lint Job**: Code quality checks with ESLint
3. **CodeQL Scan**: GitHub-native security scanning (no self-hosted runner required)
4. **Gitleaks Scan**: Secret detection scanning to identify exposed credentials
5. **Build-Test Job**: Creates artifacts and registers them in CloudBees Unify
6. **Deploy Jobs**: Simulates deployments to dev/staging/production environments

### Environments
- **Development**: Auto-deploys from `develop` branch
- **Staging**: Auto-deploys from `main` branch (with smoke tests)
- **Production**: Manual approval required, deploys from `main` after staging

## Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure you have:

1. **CloudBees Unify Account**: Access to a CloudBees Unify instance
2. **GitHub Repository**: This repository pushed to GitHub
3. **Jira Board** (Optional): For linking work items to deployments
4. **GitHub Actions**: Enabled on your repository

## Setup Instructions

### 1. CloudBees Unify Configuration

#### Create Environments in Unify
Before running workflows, create the following environments in CloudBees Unify:

```yaml
- development (non-production)
- staging (non-production)
- production (production)
```

You can use the `cloudbees-environments.yml` file as a reference for environment configuration.

### 2. GitHub Repository Configuration

#### Configure GitHub Environments
1. Go to **Settings** > **Environments**
2. Create three environments:
   - `development`: No protection rules
   - `staging`: No protection rules (or add required reviewers if desired)
   - `production`: Add required reviewers and enable "Wait timer" if desired

### 3. Initial Workflow Run

1. Push this code to your GitHub repository
2. Create a `develop` branch: `git checkout -b develop && git push -u origin develop`
3. Make a commit to `develop` to trigger the workflow
4. The workflow will:
   - Run tests and publish results to CloudBees Unify
   - Perform linting checks
   - Run CodeQL security scan
   - Run Gitleaks secret detection scan
   - Build and register the artifact
   - Deploy to development environment

      ...
```

**Note**: `register-deployed-artifact` action is currently disabled in the workflow as it's not yet released. Deployment tracking will be enabled when the action becomes available.

## Additional Workflows

### Manage Test Secrets Workflow
The repository includes a utility workflow (`manage-test-secrets.yml`) for testing secret detection:

**Purpose**: Creates or deletes a test file (`env.test`) containing fake credentials for Gitleaks validation

**Usage**:
1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select **"Manage Test Secrets File"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Choose action: **create** or **delete**

**Features**:
- Fake credentials are base64 encoded in the workflow to avoid detection
- Decodes and writes plaintext secrets to `env.test` file for Gitleaks to detect
- Automatically commits and pushes changes
- Useful for validating secret scanning integration

## Customization

### Add More Environments
1. Add environment definition in `cloudbees-environments.yml`
2. Create environment in CloudBees Unify
3. Add new deploy job in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
4. Configure environment in GitHub repository settings

### Integrate with Jira
Add Jira issue keys to commits to link deployments to work items:

```bash
git commit -m "PROJ-123: Add new feature"
```

CloudBees Unify will automatically associate deployments with Jira issues.

### Use Different CI Providers
The same CloudBees actions are available for:
- Jenkins/CBCI (pipeline steps)
- Other CI systems (API-based integration)
